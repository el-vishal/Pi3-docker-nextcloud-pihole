add jwilder's nginx reverse proxy position


Error: Address already in use
I ran into bind issues as well, but I did show port 53 listening. In my case, on a fresh install the server is running DNS services. I stopped it with:


sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved

Seems like Pi-hole works irrespective of Misconfigured DNS 127.0.0.11 warning

I was facing the exact same warning, along with service errors
pihole_1 | chown: cannot access '': No such file or directory pihole_1 | chmod: cannot access '': No such file or directory pihole_1 | chown: cannot access '/etc/pihole/dhcp.leases': No such file or directory

Not mounting var logs strangely solved it
